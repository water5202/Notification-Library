very **simple** notification library I made because me wanted to make some kind of UI lib before I leave roblox exploiting, since it's so risky to do and I copied Horion's (MCBE HORION) countdown system
```lua
example usage:
TheNotifier = loadstring(game:HttpGet("MyScriptLink")
TheNotifier.Notify("Title" <str>, "Text" <str>, Duration <int>)
```
#
tl;dr All the other Notification UIs didn't fit my preference so I made my own
